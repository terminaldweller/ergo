# devourer

## About
Devourer is meant to be a sort of a knowledge aggregator though it has quite a long way to get there.<br/>
Right now it can get text out of certain formats, summarize them or not and turn them into audio or not.<br/>
There is a little feature that searches for a term  on wikipedia and one that extracts requirements from RFCs.<br/>

To see what endpoints are present and how to use them or interact with them go to `/docs`. Devourer is powered by fastapi. Everything is in its default location.<br/>

## Live Instance
There is a live instance on https://mila.terminaldweller.com/mila.<br/>
You can look at the docs [here](https://mila.terminaldweller.com/docs).<br/>

## How to Run
Run one of the two compose files. The test compose file uses self-signed certificates for local testing since devourer only supports https.<br/>
